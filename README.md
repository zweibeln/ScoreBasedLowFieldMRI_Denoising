# ScoreBasedMRI_Denoising
I created this repository to try score based generative model through SDE on denoising low field MRI images.

In order to use the code you should first download the knee_mri_dataset from https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu. Then, you should read the hp5y files and convert them into images, and
save the images as 'knee_train.txt' or 'knee_val.txt' format. Finally, put the data set inside the utils folder. Afterwards you can call any '.py'.
